# Assignment 01

## Lab 1 activity

You should set up a C++ compiler and an IDE. Choose any IDE and compiler you prefer. Later on in the semester we will also work with the Qt framework. Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 can be integrated with Qt development tools.

If you choose Microsoft Visual Studio, the *Community* version is free.

Create a new C project and a simple “Hello, World!” C application.

**Assignment 1 consists of the following requirements and is due in week 2.**

## Requirements
- Write a **C application** (not C++!) with a menu based console interface which solves one of the problems below. 
- Menu entries are expected for: 
    - reading a vector of numbers from the console,
    - solving each of the 2 required functionalities,
    - exiting the program. 
- Each requirement must be resolved using at least one function. Functions communicate via input/output parameters and the return statement.
- Provide specifications for all functions.

## Problem Statements
3.	**a.** Print the Pascal triangle of dimension `n` of all combinations `C(m,k)` of m objects taken by `k, k = 0, 1, ..., m`, for line `m, where m = 1, 2, ..., n`.\
**b.** Given a vector of numbers, find the longest contiguous subsequence of prime numbers.
